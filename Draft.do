/* Data Description 
Data came from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), released by 
the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging in 2017. The CLHLS surveys 
include seven waves of data which are released in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010 
and 2014 respectively. The CLHLS provides information on health status and quality of 
life of the elderly aged 65 and older in China,included socioeconomic characteristics, 
family, lifestyle, and demographic profile of this aged population. A national representative 
sample of people aged 65 or older was drawn. The dataset covers 23 out of 31 provinces in China, 
including five minority autonomous regions. These minority autonomous regions that have
a much higher proportion of minority group concentration are Guangxi, Inner Mongolia,
Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Tibet. In this study, the data from the 2014 wave of the CLHLS
surveys will be utilized because it is easy to observe the effect of the health disparity
on the older population in one dataset. The study sample consists of 7,192 older adults
aged 65 and over; 7% (n=495) of them are ethnic minorities. In addition, it comprises
3,212 urban elderly which accounting for 44.6% of the sample and 3,980 rural elderly.
The response rate was 97.7 percent.

/* Research Goal
This research is about health disparity for Chinese elderly. This research aims to 
find out how geographic and ethnicity of residents affect collectively on health quality of old 
people in China. In other words, this study will assess the impact of geographic 
and ethnic disparity on the health outcome of the Chinese elderly.
*/

/* Research Question
1. Does the majority elderly have a better health status than their minority counterpart, as the literature suggest? 
2. Does the elderly living in urban area live longer than their counterpart in rural area?
*/

/* Hypothesis 
Hypothesis 1: The Han (majority) elderly living in an urban area have a better health status than those in a rural area. 
Hypothesis 2: The Han (majority) elderly living in an urban area have a better health status than the minorities in an urban area. 
Hypothesis 3: The Han (majority) elderly living in a rural area have a better health status than the minorities in an urban area.
Hypothesis 4: The minorities elderly living in an urban area have a better health status than those in a rural area.
*/

/* Variables 
Independent Variables: age,education,income and employment status. 
* Justification of use these variables: Health disparity is not simply related to differences 
in health. The fundamental-cause theory insists that socioeconomic status 
is a fundamental cause of health disparity. Disparities in health have persisted in developed countries 
and groups who experience some of the greatest disparities in health tend to experience the greatest 
socioeconomic disparities. Shavers argues that SES is a significant contributor to the disparate 
health observed among ethnic groups in different regions (rural/ urban). Based on Shaversâ€™s model, 
the study measure SES included occupation, income, and education.  Using this model, the socioeconomic 
status of the ethnic group of elderly from urban/ rural areas are the independent variables. 
Dependent Variables: self-rated health status,functional capacity.
Control Variables:gender, marital status, family size.
